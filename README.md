A comprehensive Playwright + TypeScript test suite implemented using the **Page Object Model (POM)** pattern against [UITestingPlayground](http://uitestingplayground.com). This repository is a learning and portfolio project demonstrating practical UI automation skills including locators, assertions, handling overlays/offscreen elements, AJAX, delayed loads, progress bars, dialogs, Shadow DOM, file uploads, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates practical UI automation skills using Playwright and TypeScript. It showcases my ability to:

- Write maintainable, scalable test automation code
- Implement industry-standard design patterns (Page Object Model)
- Handle complex UI testing scenarios (dynamic content, async operations, cross-browser compatibility)
- Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines
- Write clear, readable, and well-documented test code

**Perfect for**: Junior QA Automation Engineer positions requiring Playwright/TypeScript experience.

## 💻 How the Code is Organized

- **Page Objects** follow a consistent pattern: locators (private), constructor(page), public actions, then private helpers
- **Tests** use a `PageManager` to obtain page objects and call their public actions
- **Assertions** prefer Playwright `Locator` APIs and web-first assertions like `toBeVisible`, `toHaveText`, and `toHaveAttribute`
- **Geometric checks** (offscreen/overlap) use `getBoundingClientRect()` via `locator.evaluate(...)`
- **Utility functions** are extracted to `utils/` for reusability across tests

### Code Example

This example demonstrates the style used in this repo (POM + web-first assertion):

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { PageManager } from '../page-objects/pageManager';

test.beforeEach(async({page}) => {
    await page.goto('https://www.uitestingplayground.com/')
})

test('navigate to dynamic ID page and click on button with dynamic ID', async ({page}) => {
    const pm = new PageManager(page);
    await pm.onHomePage().navigateToDynamicIdPage();
    await page.waitForURL(/\/dynamicid$/);
    await pm.onDynamicIdPage().clickOnButtonWithDynamicId();  
})
```

## ✨ Best Practices Used

- ✅ Use descriptive page object names: `HomePage`, `VisibilityPage`, `ProgressBarPage`, etc.
- ✅ Keep locators in one place (constructor) and mark them `private readonly`
- ✅ Favor `expect(locator).toHaveText()` / `toHaveAttribute()` which auto-wait for updates
- ✅ Use small, deterministic tests that each assert one behavior
- ✅ Extract common helpers (e.g., `isOffscreen`, `isCovered`) to `BasePage` or `utils/` when shared
- ✅ Follow consistent naming conventions and code structure
- ✅ Implement proper cleanup in test hooks (e.g., `test.afterAll()`)

## 📝 Notes for Hiring Managers

This repository serves as a **portfolio demonstration** of my Playwright automation skills. Key highlights:

- ✅ **Production-ready code**: Follows Playwright best practices and industry standards
- ✅ **Maintainable architecture**: Clean Page Object Model implementation
- ✅ **CI/CD integration**: Fully automated test execution pipeline
- ✅ **Cross-browser coverage**: Tests run on all major browsers
- ✅ **Real-world scenarios**: Covers common UI testing challenges (AJAX, delays, dynamic content, file uploads)

**Known Limitations:**
- The "Click" scenario is intentionally skipped on WebKit due to anti-automation design in the demo application (documented in test code)
- 3 remaining scenarios (Animated Button, Disabled Input, Auto Wait) are planned for completion

**Next Steps**: Completing the remaining 3 scenarios to achieve 100% coverage of the UI Testing Playground.

## 🤝 How to Contribute / Extend

- **To add a new page object**: Create `page-objects/YourPageNamePage.ts` with locators, actions, and helpers
- **To add a new test**: Create a spec in `tests/` (consider one file per page/feature for scalability)
- **Best practices**: Keep tests readable and small. Use `PageManager` to access page objects from tests
